# Node-Red #

All my simples automation are done in Home Assistant. But when it needs to be more complex, I'm using Node-Red. This application permits to build a graph very visual, close to Houdini, the VFX program I'm using for my work.

I'm sure, some of the flows can be done directly in HA. But I keep doing it with Node-Red for learning the software.

I decided to share my flows to give some ideas or for maybe help some users. I don't have years of Node-Red experience, so I'm sure it possible to get better graph. Feel free to share your tips.

Thanks
