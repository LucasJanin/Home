# On Air Light #

Because Work From home isn't any more a short-term solution, I'm starting to thinking about what can be done to improve my work/family balance. During the day, I have many Zoom meetings, but not all the time. My family never know when they can enter my office without disturbing me. As a result, I hadn't seen them during the day, sad when we are all at home.

So I decided to create an "On Air" Light for notifying outside of my office the current status with RGB light. The hardware part was very cheap and easy to do. I learned electrical installation during my last home renovation with my handy-men. I'm living in Canada, so your electrical code may be different in your country.

WARNING! You aren't comfortable to do electricity, use a professional electrician.

By chance, I have a light switch on the other side of the wall. Only a short cable and no hole was needed, except for the Outlet Box.

For the software side, the [Home Assistant Mac Companion](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2020/09/18/mac-companion/) gives me very useful sensors like FaceTime camera and micro. For the Mac presence in the room, I'm using my [Mac Occupancy Template](../../../HomeAssistant/macOccupancyTemplate) to know if my Mac is connected to the ethernet. Aqara sensors are connected via [Zigbee2mqtt](https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/koenkk/zigbee2mqtt) and [Mosquito](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-mosquitto/).

For more detail of my configuration, I invite you to check my [Software](software.md) and [Hardware](hardware.md) pages.

The "On Air" light is only turn on when someone is opening or closing the basement door or the motion sensor in the basement got triggered. The office is considered empty if the computer isn't connected to ethernet or the office's motion sensor is clear.

The light change color base on the status of the different sensors:

- [x] Green: the computer is connected to ethernet and no using this camera and micro
- [x] Red: the computer is connected to ethernet and the camera is used
- [x] Pink: the computer is connected to ethernet and micro is used
- [x] White: the office is empty and illumination is below 150 lux

As for all my automation, I created an input boolean for turn off automation from HA, HomeKit, and Siri

Insert in the configuration.yaml
```yml
input_boolean:
   on_air_automation:
      name: On Air Automation
      icon: mdi:home-automation
      initial: true
```
